**Experience**

As a Frontend Developer Intern, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects, honing my skills and gaining practical experience in web development. Below is a summary of what I've accomplished so far:

**2024:**

- **ReactJS Projects**:  
  I started the year by diving into React.js, building several interactive, dynamic websites and user interfaces. I learned how to create reusable components, manage state with React's hooks, and integrate various APIs to fetch and display data. 

- **UI/UX Design**:  
  I focused on understanding user-centric design principles, using tools like Figma to create wireframes, and translating them into functional, responsive websites. I paid close attention to accessibility and user experience, ensuring all websites I built were both visually appealing and intuitive to use.

- **GSAP Animations**:  
  I explored the power of GSAP to add dynamic, smooth animations to web projects. This enhanced the user experience by making the websites more interactive and engaging.

- **SCSS & Styling**:  
  I worked with SCSS to create modular, scalable stylesheets, making the styling process more efficient and maintainable. I also fine-tuned responsive design practices to ensure that websites function seamlessly across different screen sizes.

- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**:  
  I implemented best practices for version control, using Git to manage my code and GitHub to collaborate on repositories. This ensured my work was properly tracked, and I was able to stay organized while learning from previous iterations of my code.

- **Web Deployment**:  
  I deployed several of my projects to platforms like Vercel, ensuring they were production-ready and accessible online. I gained experience configuring build processes and troubleshooting deployment issues.

- **AXA Mansard Website Project**:  
  I contributed to improving the AXA Mansard website by working on meta tags, optimizing performance, and enhancing the overall design. I collaborated with a team of designers and developers, integrating their feedback into the website.

- **Insurance Product Proposal**:  
  I contributed to the proposal of insurance products, including health, life, and business insurance, with a focus on presenting them through a seamless, user-friendly interface on the website.

- **Collaboration and Learning**:  
  Throughout the year, I worked alongside mentors and senior developers to solve real-world problems. I participated in code reviews, collaborated on improving project workflows, and consistently learned new tools and techniques.

These experiences have allowed me to grow both as a developer and a team member, and I’m excited to continue expanding my skill set and contributing to future projects.
